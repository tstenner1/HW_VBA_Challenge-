# HW_VBA_Challenge-

For the homework during the weekend over the course of struggling and long hours at some point towards the end I was able to get the results.  However after I got it to work i did not save it and then i forgot to.  The code is almost right there are a few debugging issues that I cannot seem to resolve.  I understand if that will result in some points off.  There perhaps could be a line or two i just wasnt sure still applied or not, at one point i was trying to do the challenge part and then got it all mixed up.  This was quite challenging.

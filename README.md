# VBA 

In this repository I use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

## VBA Execution 

* I created a script that looped through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* Conditional formatting was key to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
